# Destiny Chrome Extension
A Chrome Extension to change the appearance of the DestinyONE Staff View TEST 
environment. Makes it abundantly obvious that you're in TEST vs PROD. [Turns the 
banner and footer yellow, and adds a light yellow background to the entire page.]

Also adds yellow banner styles to the STAGING Website, the DEV Website, and the 
DestinyOne Public View TEST.

Adapted from the UC Berkeley extension at https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-Extension/destiny-chrome-extension

Rewritten to be compatible with Manifest V3.
